# C-Linked-List

Author: John Toledo
====================

This is a pure implmentation of a Stack linked list developed in C
Compiled using windows and Linux environments with no issues.

To Test all the features/operations of a typical linked list,
I have added a menu that prompts the user for specified operation.

This will help you visually understand how a stack-linked list should function,
and reading through the source code may assist you in developing your very own
linked list in C.
